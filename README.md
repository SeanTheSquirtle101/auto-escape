# AutoEscape

## NOTE: This alpha version of the mod requires BTD6 Mod Helper >v3.0, see [here](https://github.com/doombubbles/BTD6-Mods#readme) for the stable mods

A simple mod to automatically quit to the main menu when a Bloon would otherwise leak and kill you.

You won't be Black Bordering any maps with this, but you should at least save the Monkey Money on Continues.
